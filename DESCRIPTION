Description: A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of height,
    weight and fluid compartments of adults and children. Each formula is
    referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be given for
    estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges. Future functions
    will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical
    care and peri-operative medicine.
