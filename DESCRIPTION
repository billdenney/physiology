      person(given = "Jack O. Wasey",
             role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),

Description: A variety of formulae are provided for estimation
    of height, weight and fluid compartments of adults and children. Each
    formula is referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be
    given for estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges.
    Future functions will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia,
    critical care and peri-operative medicine.
