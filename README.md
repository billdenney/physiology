## Calculate physiological characteristics of adults and children

A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of height, weight and
fluid compartments of adults and children. Each formula is referenced to
the original publication. Warnings can be given for estimation based on
input data outside of normal ranges. Future functions will cover more
material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative
medicine.

Functions are provided for estimation of a range of physiologic
characteristics of infants, child and adult humans.

  - Height, weight and fluid compartments.
  - Henderson-Hasslebalch
  - Alveolar gas equation
  - Airway deadspace

Each formula is referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be
given for estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges.
Future functions will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia,
critical care and peri-operative medicine.
