## Calculate physiological characteristics of adults and children

A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of height,
weight and fluid compartments of adults and children. Each formula is
referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be given for
estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges. Future functions
will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical
care and peri-operative medicine.
