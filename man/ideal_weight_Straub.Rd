}
\usage{
ideal_weight_Straub(heightm, age.years = NULL, age.months = NULL,
  age.days = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightm}{single numeric, height in meters}

\item{age.years}{numeric vector, age(s) in years. TODO: there must be a
better way of capturing age. 'lubridate' doesn't seem to help much, and
adds complexity and a dependency.}

\item{age.months}{numeric vector, age(s) in months}

\item{age.days}{numeric vector, age(s) in days}

\item{...}{arguments passed to downstream functions, e.g. \code{warn = TRUE}}
}
\description{
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6823980 2.396e0.01863(ht),
  where height is in cm. There is an argument for using another package to
  capture durations, of which age is a special case. However, I am resisting
  bringing in external dependencies, and for almost all use-cases I can
  imagine, the age will be captured as a single number of one type, not a mix
  of types. Note that gender does not appear to be important in this
  relationship.

  See package AGD for CDC growth chart data.
